## Watch the wiggly worms\!

### Description

Possibly *the* most useless program ever, but on full screen, watch the worms travel their random path around the screen to build a totally strange texture. It's really quite hypnotic.

Ideas:

- In a banner ratio, it makes a good moving background

- Make the worms black to clear the screen

- Would make a super screen saver

- Ideal for creating textures (using gausian/motion blur)

Feel free to change this to your liking.

Please comment on what you do with this.
 
### More Info
 
Change lNumParticles for the number of particles on screen

looks very different with a different draw width
